TimeFresh: The Quest for Sushi

This game is a dungeon crawler in which two players team up in order to quest for sushi. Before both players are connected, a singular player 
who is connected can move around the screen at his / her leisure. Once both players have connected, approach the cat 
in order to start your quest for sushi. Use the arrow keys to move and the 'a' and 'd' keys to rotate. Then use space bar to shoot. Take out the enemies
to reveal a piece of sushi and advance to the next level. Both players must be touching the piece of sushi in order to continue!
However; there is a catch to TimeFresh. Since you and your friend really want some sushi, you are not afraid to alter time a litle bit
to get the job done. Whenever you and your friend are not moving or shooting, time will slow giving you two a chance to strategize. If one player is
moving or shooting, time speeds up. If both are moving or shooting then be careful; time goes fast! Plan out a strategy with your friend,
and go get some sushi! Don't forget to collect health drops from enemies after you defeat them; you may need the help.
